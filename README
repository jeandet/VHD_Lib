gaisler's grlib and use its features. For setup read instalation section.


| REQUIREMENTS
| ~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use this library you need the grlib and linux shell or mingw for windows users.

To set up the VHD_Lib follow this steps:
	-download and setup the grlib
	-create a VARIABLE called GRLIB with value the path to the grlib folder.
	-untar the VHD_Lib and type "make Patch-GRLIB"
	-now you can use the grlib's Makefiles and designs.
Please note that if you try "make help" you will see all targets and if the GRLIB variable is correct.


| HACKING
